## This project focuses on the utilization of data pipelines to efficiently clean and prepare data for use on various machine learning algorithms

Included:
* Standardizing string data and removing outliers
* Creation of a data pipeline to clean and encode data
* Comparison of various machine learning algorithms on the dataset
* Hyper-parameter tuning for the best performing algorithm

Dataset aquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data)
